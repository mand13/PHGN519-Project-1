The Multiplexer Truth Table Simulation Jupyter notebook code is well commented and guides the user through the process of creating a quantum circuit. Specifically, the code creates a multiplexer using 4 qubits, a classical bit, a CNOT gate, and two Toffoli gates. The Jupyter notebook draws a diagram of the circuit and a bar graph showing which input combinations result in which output.

The Hadamard Simulation notebook is similar, but it shows the circuit utilizing a Hadamard gate. This demonstrates how superposition states can be passed through a multiplexer.
